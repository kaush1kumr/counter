Hello everyone!!!!

I'm Learning JavaScript, so this is the first ever mini project i made, on the day 1.
A Simple Counter, with 3 buttons which decrease the count, increase the count and one to reset it.
tbh this project felt like even a 5 year old will build this thing easily, and shameless me feeling proud of this lol

Well whatever more big and complex projects will be coming here soon...
Hope you'll be here to see them ;}

SeeYaa :)
